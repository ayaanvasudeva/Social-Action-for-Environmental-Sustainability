                             <p>We chose flooding as it is a common issue in New Zealand due to global warming. The floods last year impacted many houses and affected the lives of many.

                                   <p>We will do this by educating people about this issue, this could be through social media posts or even writing educated articles. We could also host events that help those affected by the flooding to support and educate people about this problem. We could also make petitions to look after the environment (global warming ‚Üí flooding) etc.</p>

        <div>
            <p>I hope to achieve a world where there are things in place to delegate this problem of flooding. This could happen by building better infrastructure to combat flooding (bettter drainage). We could reduce our carbon footprint (do other things as well) reducing global warming therefore reducing flooding.</p>
