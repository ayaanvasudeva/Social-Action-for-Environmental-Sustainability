                                   <p>We will do this by educating people about this issue, this could be through social media posts or even writing educated articles. We could also host events that help those affected by the flooding to support and educate people about this problem. We could also make petitions to look after the environment (global warming ‚Üí flooding) etc.</p>

            <p>I hope to achieve a world where there are things in place to delegate this problem of flooding. This could happen by building better infrastructure to combat flooding (bettter drainage). We could reduce our carbon footprint (do other things as well) reducing global warming therefore reducing flooding.</p>

                <p>The social media part could be carried out anywhere as we are using our phones or devices. Events & petitions could be carried out in school and emails could be sent out to politicians to take it to a deeper level.</p>
