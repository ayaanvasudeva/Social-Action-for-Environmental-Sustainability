                 Floods
                 Causes
                 <ul>
                     <li>-heavy rainfall as the systems used to take out this access water (sewage systems) are overflowed.
                       This access water can come from the ice melting from Mountain ranges in (eg. south island fox glacier)
                       Climate change which has made the rain in NZ unpredictable and causing more rain to happen making more access water</li>
                     <li></li>
                     <img src = "pic6.jpg">
                      Flood effects
                     <li>
                        
                      -Can destroy agriculture (crops, plants etc.)
                      Can destory infrastructure (buildings, shops, houses etc.)
                      Could destroy important transportation routes (e.g. bridge where lots of cars cross through each day)
                      If it destroyed houses it could affect the mental wellbeing of the people living in it
                         </li>
                     <img src="pic5.jpg">
                 </ul>
                 Lockdowns were taken in place to stay at home when the floods happened so 
                 people would be safer. They made maps to show which houses were in danger zones and would evacuvate acordingly.


                 These actions have not taken away the problem of flooding. But it has definitely delegated the problem reducing the chance of any injuries to happen etc.
   <img src="pic7.jpg">
                Flooding is linked indirecty to global warming. If we stop emiting carbon emissions (use renewable energy) and limit our carbon footprint it will indirefctly help stop global warming. If this warming is stopped then less arctic ice will be melted and less floods will occur.

            <p>I hope to achieve a world where there are things in place to delegate this problem of flooding. This could happen by building better infrastructure to combat flooding (bettter drainage). We could reduce our carbon footprint (do other things as well) reducing global warming therefore reducing flooding.</p>
